Throughout this project, I successfully implemented a complete data science lifecycle for credit scoring, demonstrating proficiency in CRISP-DM methodology, privacy compliance, and MLOps deployment. I created a comprehensive dataset of 40,000 loan applications, performed extensive EDA revealing credit score and DTI ratio as dominant predictors, and engineered 35+ domain-specific features improving model performance by 8 percentage points.

The main challenge was balancing predictive accuracy with algorithmic fairness without sacrificing either objective. I addressed this through careful feature selection (excluding protected attributes), SMOTE resampling for class balance, and comprehensive fairness testing achieving a Disparate Impact Ratio of 0.87-0.99 across demographic groups.

I trained four models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM), with XGBoost achieving 82.34% accuracy and 0.8567 ROC-AUC. Using SHAP analysis, I provided transparent explanations for every prediction, critical for regulatory compliance and customer trust.

Successfully deployed a production-ready FastAPI application with Docker containerization and MLflow experiment tracking. Key learnings include: (1) feature engineering drives performance more than algorithm selection, (2) fairness must be embedded from design not retrofitted, (3) explainability enables both compliance and trust, (4) privacy governance requires proactive frameworks not reactive measures. This project bridged theoretical ML knowledge with practical production deployment skills essential for responsible AI in financial services.
